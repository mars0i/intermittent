Experiments with intermittent between-group communication.  
Generalizes BaliPlus in the bali repo.  
</p>
<p>
Within-group communication is common, between-group communication is uncommon.
With success-bias where success depends on group state: Each
individual copies the most successful of all those who talk to it on a
given timestep.  Neighbors (gray lines) always talk to each other.
Others talk to each other, randomly, as well.
