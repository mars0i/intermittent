Cultural transmission with intermittent between-group communication and
success bias.  Inspired by BaliPlus in my bali repo.  Each individual
copies the most successful of those who talk to it on a tick.  Neighbors
(gray lines) always talk to each other.  Others talk to others,
randomly, as well.  Transparent greenish lines represent an individual (wide)
learning from another individual (narrow).  Colors represent religious or
other cultural variants.  Little pointers represent an individual's
current success, which is partly a function of its neighbors' religious
values.
