Experiments with intermittent between-group communication,
generalizing BaliPlus in my bali repo.  
Within-group communication is common, between-group communication
is
uncommon, with success bias:
Each individual copies the most successful of those who talk to it
on a tick.  Neighbors (gray lines) always talk to each other.
Others talk to others, randomly, as well.  Green lines represent
an individual (narrow) learning
from another individual (wide).  Colors represent religious or
other cultural variants.  Little pointers represent an individual's 
current success, which is partly a function of its neighbors'
religious values.
